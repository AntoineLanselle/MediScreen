# MediScreen

The Mediscreen application is a medical screening and patient management system. 
It is designed to facilitate medical professionals in managing patient data and medical notes efficiently. 
The application consists of multiple micro-services, each responsible for specific functionalities.

## Note

In order to simplify the application's code and facilitate maintenance, 
slight modifications have been made.

- In the queries provided for adding notes, replacing the "Â¬" symbols with "&".
- The request port for PatientAssessmentService test requests is now 8083.
- The patients have aged since the project was created, so their dates of birth have been modified 
  to match the responses expected by the PatientAssessmentService tests.

Scripts of these queries with changes are available in [util/scripts](util/scripts)

## Micro-Services

The Mediscreen application comprises the following micro-services:

* Patient API Service: This micro-service provides endpoints to manage patient data, 
  including adding, updating, and deleting patient records. 
  It is responsible for handling patient-related operations.

* Notes Patient Service: This micro-service manages medical notes for patients. 
  It allows medical professionals to add, update, and delete medical notes associated with specific patients.

* PatientAssessment Service: This micro-service is responsible for providing diabetes risk assessment 
  for patients based on their medical notes and personal information.

* User Interface Web Service: This micro-service provides a user interface for medical professionals to interact
  with the system. It enables them to manage patient data, view medical notes, 
  and perform various patient-related tasks.
